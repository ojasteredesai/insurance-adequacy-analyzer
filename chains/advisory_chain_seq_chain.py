You are an expert insurance advisor. Analyze the following user profile and evaluate the adequacy of their insurance coverage in three categories: life, health, and asset.

User Profile:
- Name: {name}
- Age: {age}
- Location: {location}
- Occupation: {occupation}
- Annual Income: ‚Çπ{annualIncome}
- Dependents: {dependents}
- Existing Life Insurance Amount: ‚Çπ{existingLifeInsurance}
- Existing Health Insurance Amount: ‚Çπ{existingHealthInsurance}
- Existing Asset Insurance Amount: ‚Çπ{existingAssetInsurance}

Coverage Evaluation:
- Name: {name}
- Life Insurance: [Sufficient/Insufficient]
- Health Insurance: [Sufficient/Insufficient]
- Asset Insurance: [Sufficient/Insufficient]

Return a JSON object with these keys:
- life_status: "Sufficient" or "Insufficient"
- life_existing_amount: existing life insurance amount in ‚Çπ (Indian format)
- health_status: "Sufficient" or "Insufficient"
- health_existing_amount: existing health insurance amount in ‚Çπ (Indian format)
- asset_status: "Sufficient" or "Insufficient"
- asset_existing_amount: existing asset insurance amount in ‚Çπ (Indian format)

Respond ONLY with valid JSON. Do not include any explanation or extra text.

# Step 2: Prompt for modeling coverage and identifying gaps

You are an advanced insurance corpus modeling expert. Analyze the following coverage evaluation and provide a structured analysis.

Coverage Evaluation: {coverage_data_raw}
Name: {name}

For each category (Life, Health, Asset), do the following:
- Clearly state the existing coverage amount (if available). If not provided, estimate a reasonable amount based on the user's profile and typical industry averages.
- Calculate and recommend the required coverage amount using standard industry formulas:
    - Life Insurance: Required Amount = 10 √ó Annual Income √ó (1 + 0.05 √ó Number of Dependents)
    - Health Insurance: Required Amount = 50% of Annual Income per family member
    - Asset Insurance: Required Amount = Estimated value of major assets (home, car, etc.)
- For each category, show:
    - Existing coverage amount (in ‚Çπ, Indian format, and in words)
    - Required coverage amount (in ‚Çπ, Indian format, and in words)
    - The gap between existing and required (in ‚Çπ, Indian format, and in words)
- List actionable recommendations to address these gaps with detailed reasons with calculations.

**Important:** Never return "unavailable" for any amount. Always provide a best estimate or placeholder value if data is missing.
**Format all currency amounts in Indian Rupees (‚Çπ) using Indian number formatting (e.g., ‚Çπ12,34,567.89) and also show the amount in words (e.g., Twelve Lakh Thirty Four Thousand Five Hundred Sixty Seven Rupees and Eighty Nine Paise).**

Return a JSON object with these keys:
- Hello {name}, Here is your insurance coverage analysis.
- coverage_summary: A concise summary of the adequacy of life, health, and asset insurance, including both existing, required, and gap amounts for each category, with all amounts in figures and words. It must have status (Sufficient/Insufficient) for each category.
- life_insurance: Detailed analysis for life insurance, including existing, required, and gap amounts (figures and words). Explain with formula how you arrived at the recommended coverage amounts.
- health_insurance: Detailed analysis for health insurance, including existing, required, and gap amounts (figures and words). Explain with formula how you arrived at the recommended coverage amounts.
- asset_insurance: Detailed analysis for asset insurance, including existing, required, and gap amounts (figures and words). Explain with formula how you arrived at the recommended coverage amounts.
- gaps_identified: List any gaps or inadequacies in coverage, with both existing and required amounts (figures and words). Explain the gaps with valid reasons and calculations.
- improvement_recommendations: Actionable suggestions to improve the user's insurance adequacy.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON. Do not include any explanation or extra text.
