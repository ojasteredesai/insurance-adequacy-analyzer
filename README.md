# Insurance Adequacy Analyzer (IAA)

## Overview

Insurance Adequacy Analyzer (IAA) is an interactive Streamlit application powered by advanced LLMs (OpenAI GPT-4o or Mistral). It helps users assess the adequacy of their life, health, and asset insurance coverage based on their personal profile and industry benchmarks. The app provides actionable recommendations and models required coverage amounts using standard formulas.
